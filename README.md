# Data_engineering_labs
Production-grade distributed data engineering labs focused on Spark internals, large-scale performance tuning, skew handling, streaming state management, and FAANG-level system design.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is not a tutorial collection.

It is a hands-on distributed systems playground designed to simulate production-scale data engineering challenges such as:

- Data skew detection and mitigation
- Join strategy analysis (Broadcast vs SortMerge)
- Shuffle internals and spill behavior
- Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) tuning
- Streaming state store mechanics
- Deterministic performance scaling
- Large-scale workload simulation

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

Most engineers optimize syntax.

Senior engineers optimize distributed behavior.

These labs focus on:

- Understanding Spark physical plans
- Quantifying performance bottlenecks
- Designing for predictable scaling
- Building systems that survive growth
